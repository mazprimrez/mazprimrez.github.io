<p>Vidio is a leading streaming services in Indonesia. I mainly focused on the recommendation system, though I also developed churn prediction and content performance prediction.</p>

<h4>Notable Projects</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented a recommendation model collaborative filtering using the cosine similarity algorithm. Achieved a remarkable 0.2 Recall@20 and 10%+ click-through rate (CTR), surpassing in-house model-based recommendation systems.</li>
    <li>Utilizing semi-supervised learning and GPT-4 model to extract micro genres from movies synopsis description for a better hybrid recommendation system. This method speeds the tagging process time by more than 80%.</li>
    <li>Engineered ETL pipelines for cleaning unpublished films in existing tables, resulting in a 90% reduction in API errors. Improved data quality and streamlined processing workflows.</li>
    <li>Collaborated with Marketing Team predicting persuadable non-subscribers to subscribe. Predictive modeling is built using Tensorflow Neural Networks and achieved an 87% AUC score, resulting in a 20% conversion rate among targeted users.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tools</h4>
<p>Tools that are mainly used are.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Python for Data Analysis and Data Scientist</b>, e.g. pandas, sk-learn, and tensorflow.</li>
    <li><b>Deployment Tools</b>, Flask, Dataproc Google Cloud Platform</li>
